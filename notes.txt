-implement sorting
-handle the "pack" field of Card class including when card objects are created in the cardreader
-separate deckTable by cardtypes? (like have dividers)
-alternate views: list view and card layout view (like where you just have all the cards lined up adjacent like in real life) - would be nice to have drag and drop interface with this as well
-need to maintain selection even after adding and removing (bug)
-"searchable text/translations/card attributes (brainstorm, change, bond, etc.)" - so i need to add searching to the card tree and make it a lot more robust in general. also need to implement card attributes.
-make resizing the card info panels better
-implement deck saving and exporting, etc. (automatic translation sheet maker)
-order needs to be rearranged
-put everything in draggy bars
